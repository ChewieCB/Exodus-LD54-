	A negation field has simultaneously surrounded the galaxy. The field is gradually creeping in and swallowing all matter. Stars, nebula, planets, asteroids, even black holes. The Negation Field emits no electromagnetic radiation or heat.

	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The ship's crew capacity is 3. Crew can be housed in hab blocks. Crew need air, water and food. The more crew you have, the more air, water and food they need. You can modify your ship with structrues that increase air, water or food production.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We have plenty of air and water for this crew size, but our food stocks are running low. Please build two food production buildings to increase our food production.
