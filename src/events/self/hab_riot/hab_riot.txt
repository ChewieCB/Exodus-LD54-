ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, a brawl has broken out among the crew! 
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Security officers quickly responded and broke up the brawl. Fortunately no one was killed and no equipment was damaged. 
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The ringleaders have been identified and await sentencing.

- Brawls don't just happen. Question the ringleaders and find out what their grievances are.
	The ringleaders have no issue with your command of the ship and the brawl was from a buildup of stress and fear. 
	The chance to speak has given the ringleaders a new respect for your command. They have returned to work.

	Morale up {morale_reward_1}%.

- I will not tolerate brawling on my ship, Mr Pressley. Not now, not ever.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, the ringleaders have been thrown in the ship's brig. We can leave them on a nearby planet.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): They rest of the crew are grumbling but the message is clear - your command is not to be questioned.
