ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, shortly after arriving in this sector we received a distress signal coming from a marooned ship, the Menelaus.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): According to their signal, the ship was damaged in a micro-meteorite storm. Its engines are disabled and oxygen is running low. They are a short jump from our position.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Should we help?
- Prepare a boarding party to help the Menelaus.
	We're here, Pressley. Who knows how long it'll be before another ship comes along.
	Set a course for the Menelaus and scramble engineering.
	set {chance} = range(1,100).pick_random()
	# 75% chance success
	if {chance} >= 25:
		The crew of the Menelaus are grateful for aid, but the ship is beyond repair.
		- Invite the crew to join your ship. (Gain {pop_reward_1} crew)
			They strip the Menelaus for any useful parts and join your crew.

			Gained {pop_reward_1} Crew, {food_reward_1} Food, {water_reward_1} Water, {air_reward_1} Oxygen.
		- Leave the crew to await the next passing ship.
			We can't spare the resources to support the Menelaus' crew. 
			Pressley, rebroadcast the distress signal - another ship will pass by eventually.

	else:
		It was a trap! On docking with the Menelaus, pirates opened fire and tried to storm our ship! Our security team held them off before they crossed the docking tube and we are away.
		ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We are sending transmissions to every ship in the system to warn them about the Menelaus.
		[call_node path="ResourceManager" method="change_resource_from_event" args="["population", "-{pop_cost_1}"]" single_use="true"]
		[call_node path="ResourceManager" method="add_morale_effect_from_event" args="["-{morale_cost_2}", "Ambushed by pirates", "23", "true"]" single_use="true"]
		You lost {pop_cost_1} Crew.
- Leave the Menelaus to her fate.
	Someone else wil come along, Mr Pressley. We'll rebroadcast the message in the hope that others will hear it.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): I understand, Captain. I've ordered communications to retransmit the distress signal and send it in every direction. Hopefully someone will hear it.
