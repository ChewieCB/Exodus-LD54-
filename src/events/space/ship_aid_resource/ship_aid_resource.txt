ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, we've received a message from a nearby friendly ship. They ask if we can trade some of our food, since they are running low.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): They can give us some metal as payment. But it seem it not gonna be a lots though.

- Give them {food_cost_1} Food in exchange for Metal.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The other ship received our resources and sent back a little bit of metal. It's not much, but we should help each other.

	Gained {metal_reward_1} Metal

- Give them {food_cost_1} Food but tell them keep the Metal.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The other ship happily received our resources. It seem even though they are willing to exchange the metal, they still really need it.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Although we don't gain anything, but it seem the mood of our ship improved.

- We can't spare any resource now. Carry on, Mr Pressley.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Understood Captain, we're moving on.
