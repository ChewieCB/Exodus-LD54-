A Negation Field has simultaneously surrounded the galaxy. The field is creeping in and swallowing asteroids, nebula, planets, stars and even black holes.
- Play Intro
	No probe returns or transmits once it passes the field's event horizon. Ships, space stations and entire systems go dark every week.
	Astronomic calculations have pinpointed the field is shrinking down to a single spot - a backwater system far from most space lanes. The galaxy's greatest scientists have constructed a portal that will take us to another galaxy, beyond the Negation Field's reach.
	You are the seasoned captain of an old supply ship, requisitioned by The Concordiat to ferry cryogenically frozen colonists from the edge of the galaxy through the portal system, hoping to save yourself and your crew from certain death in the process.
