LifepodCrew: Please help us, we're... we're almost out of air.
- Send a shuttle to bring the survivors aboard (Gain {pop_reward_1} population)
	LifepodCrew: We are forever grateful for your kindness.
	LifepodCrew: With our ship destroyed, our obligation to the Rachagi Conglomerate has ended. We are capable miners and can help you extract precious resources on your travels.
	LifepodCrew: We offer this dust compressor schematic for your fabricators as a sign of good faith.

- Donate some air supplies and rebroadcast the distress signal (Lose {air_cost_1} air)
	LifepodCrew: Thank you, though I fear it may be some time until another ship comes by.
	LifepodCrew: Please take this dust compressor schematic for your fabricators as a token of our thanks.
