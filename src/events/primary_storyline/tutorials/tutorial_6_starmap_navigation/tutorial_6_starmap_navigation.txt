ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): I've marked the distress signal on your starmap.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): It's your call captain. Our metal reserves are low after all that construction. Not only would we be saving lives, we'd gain useful crew to extract metals on our journey.
- Chart a course, we need to save those miners.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Aye captain.

	Use LMB on a star to travel towards it. You can only select stars directly connected to your current star system.
	Use Shift+LMB to queue stars to travel to. Each star in the queue must be connected to the previous one.
	Use RMB to stop moving and remove any queued stars.
- We have other duties, rebroadcast the signal and let another ship answer the call (Exit Tutorial).
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): As you wish captain.
