ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Greetings, Captain. Our food production is much improved, but we need more crew to make bigger upgrades to the ship. We need more crew habitation blocks.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Build two more habitation blocks so we can take on more crew.
- Built two more crew habitation blocks.
