ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Greetings, captain. We have picked up a distress signal from a lifepod. The lifepod has {pop_reward_1} crew on board and is running low on oxygen. The distress signal says they'll join the crew of any ship who saves them.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We now have the accommodation facilities to take on extra crew. There are no other ships in the area. We should help and accept their offer to join us, as more crew means we can make more modifications to our ship.
- Contact the lifepod and welcome them into the crew.

	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Good work, Captain. We now have more crew, but more crew means we need to produce more oxygen, water and food. From now on, it's important we balance resources with each increase in the number of crew.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We have limited resources and limited space on our journey, and there'll be others who need help. Use your best judgement, Captain, but watch those resource levels.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Navigation has calculated our journey to the portal system will take 200 days. We are in your hands, Captain.
