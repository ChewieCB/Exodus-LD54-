A Negation Field has simultaneously surrounded the galaxy. The field is creeping in and swallowing asteroids, nebula, planets, stars and even black holes.

	No probe returns or transmits once it passes the field's event horizon. Ships, space stations and entire systems go dark every week.
	Astronomic calculations have pinpointed the field is shrinking down to a single spot - a backwater system far from most space lanes. The galaxy's greatest scientists have constructed a portal that will take us to another galaxy, beyond the Negation Field's reach.
	You are the captain of an old supply ship making a run for the portal system, hoping to save yourself and your crew from certain death...

	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Welcome captain, my name is Pressley, your executive officer. My job is to assist you running your Galanthir-class hauler. It's a highly modular and adaptable ship from the shipyards at Ursa Majoris.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The ship's crew capacity is three. Crew can be housed in habitation blocks. Crew need oxygen, water and food. The more crew you have, the more oxygen, water and food they need. You can modify your ship with structures that increase oxygen, water or food production.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We have plenty of oxygen and water for our current crew, but our food stocks are running low. Build two vertical farms to increase our food production.

		Click on the ship or the build button, navigate to Food tab, then choose the Vertical Farm.
		The number next to the crew icon shows the amount of crew needed to build it. The number next to clock icon shows how many days to finish the building. You can build bigger building when you have more crew.
