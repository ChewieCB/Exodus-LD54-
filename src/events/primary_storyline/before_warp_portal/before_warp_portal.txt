ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We reached the final warp portal. Seem like there are other spaceships also try to escape like us.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Maybe we can't help all of them, but I suggest try to help some at least?

IntercomGuy (Normal): I don't know Pressley. It's may better to just go through the portal now. We need all the resources we can get.
IntercomGuy (Normal): Call me bad guy if you want, but I'm just being realistic.
IntercomGuy (Normal): Though, the final decision lie on you, Captain. I trust you will make the right choice.

- Nah, let's goooo
	IntercomGuy (Normal): Great, let's go and finish the mission.
