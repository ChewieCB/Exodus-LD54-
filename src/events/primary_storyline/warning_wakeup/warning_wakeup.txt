ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, engineering have found a leak in our cryogenic systems. We don't have the materials to properly fix it, so unfortunately it looks like our cargo is starting to thaw. 
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We're re-routing the available cooling systems to keep the bigger cryo-arrays online as long as we can, but soon the smaller arrays will start to fail - and then we're going to have more mouths to feed.  
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We should ramp up our production and housing facilities accordingly.
