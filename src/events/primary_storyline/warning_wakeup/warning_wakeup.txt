ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Dear Captain, look like the hibernation fluid of our crew are running thin. 
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): I calculated that around day 50, 3 of them will wake up. Then 5 on day 100 and 10 on day 150.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Please prepare facilities to acommodate our newly awoken crewmates, Captain.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Or, you can just wake them up earlier. The first group cryopods are located near the top of the ship, with green colors. 
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The second are blue cryopods near the middle, and the last group are pink cryopods near the bottom.
