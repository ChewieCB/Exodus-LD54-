ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, planetary customs and control has found some irregularities in our docking permits. Our ship has been grounded and we are ordered to remain in port until these irregularities are resolved.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Lucky for us, this port is badly maintained and poorly guarded. We could gather the crew and slip out without delay.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): What are your orders?

- Gather the crew, Pressley. We'll sneak past port control, take back our ship and leave this system for good.
	set {chance} = range(1,100).pick_random()
	# 50% chance success
	if {chance} >= 50:
		ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, we've escaped successfully without anyone being the wiser. 
		ExecutiveOfficer (Normal):No doubt that pesky customs official will be surprised when he finds our empty berth.
		Leave ExecutiveOfficer
	else:
		ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, we escaped successfully, but I regret not all of the crew managed to get on board in time and were detained by port security. 
		ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We had to leave them behind.

		You lost {pop_cost_1} Crew.

- It's not worth the risk. We'll wait until port control gets our documents in order and we will leave as soon as we are able.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, after a prolonged stay, port control finally have our permit documentation in order. 
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): We have been granted permission to board ship and depart. 
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Let's leave this wretched planet behind.
