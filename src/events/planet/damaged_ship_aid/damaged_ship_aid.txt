ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Captain, we've received a message from a nearby ship, the Intrepid. It has made an emergency landing on a planet in this system.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The ship's hull is intact and it seems the only problem is their faulty oxygen generator. We could send some technicians down and help them with repairs.
ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): What are your orders?

- We have time and crew to spare.
	Send a memo to engineering, ask for volunteers who willing to go planetside and help the Intrepid with repairs.
	set {chance} = range(1,100).pick_random()
	# 50% chance success
	if {chance} >= 50:
		ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The technicians have reported back, they advise the Intrepid's oxygen generation is restored. They are on their way back now.
	else:
		ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): The technicians have returned and advise the Intrepid is fully-functional. The Intrepid made haste to leave the system, but not before her captain gave us a parting gift of excess water they harvested on the planet.
		Leave ExecutiveOfficer

- We can't spare the time and at least they're safe on that planet. Carry on, Mr Pressley.
	ExecutiveOfficer (Normal): Understood Captain, we're moving on.
