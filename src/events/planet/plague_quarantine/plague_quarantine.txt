- Decrypt the signal.
	It's a distress signal. It seems a spaceship had to make a crash landing on this planet. The survivors are asking for aid.
	- Send a landing party with supplies to help.[br](Requires {pop_cost_1} Crew. Costs {food_cost_1} Food and {water_cost_1} Water) [if {population} >= {pop_cost_1} and {food} >= {food_cost_1} and {water} >= {water_cost_1}]
